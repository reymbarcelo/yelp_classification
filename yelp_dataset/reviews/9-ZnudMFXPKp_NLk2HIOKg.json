Turned out to be one of the best Italian resturants I have ever eaten at! I ordered Polenta stuffed with sausage. The portions were huge! Mrs. Lenzi waited on tables herself, she was polite and efficiant. Wedding soup was flavorful and hot. Salad was fresh. Prices there are reasonable. I will certainly go back!", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Italian", "Burgers", "Sandwiches", "Restaurants"]}
