(disclaimer: I have only been once, so there is still room for error, but it was really good that one time!)\n\nMy work-friend brought myself and a third lady from work to Chanpen. I had been looking for good thai on the west side. She said it was a hole in the wall.... she wasn't joking. But often those are the best places.\n\nWe walked in (a little early for the dinner crowd) and the employees were sprawled out across the couch, watching thai soaps. I found this to be more humorous than irritating, after all it is a family place. We ordered SO.MUCH.FOOD. I thought i was going to die of overindulgence. \n\nBetween the three of us, we had an appetizer sampler, 4 entree's, and rice. I can't remember all the entree's, but I know the pad thai was amazing. What's funny about me is that I don't like curry, I don't like coconut, and I'm not huge on peanut sauce. Well, that's like 90% of thai food. This place met and exceeded my picky-thai expectations. \n\nOh, and I drank an entire pot of jasmine tea to myself. Needless to say, I went home that night and cleaned my entire apartment from top to bottom. Maybe it wasnt the caffeine.... maybe it was just a high from damn good thai!", "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "categories": ["Thai", "Restaurants"]}
