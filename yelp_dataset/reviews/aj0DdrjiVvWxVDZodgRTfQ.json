Many different types of tacos such as asada, carnita, lengua, and tripa.  You can also get complete plates with beans and rice as sides.   There is also menudo if that is one of your favorites.  Breakfast items are also available.  The building is a little odd but they have an \"A\" rating so you know the place is clean. English is not problem with the staff.  If you like real Mexican food, try this place!", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Mexican", "Restaurants"]}
