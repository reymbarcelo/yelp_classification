Best in Vegas and luckily right around the corner from me.  We get pizza here at least once a week. I love that it's in a place you'd never expect it.   Shhhhhh, it's a secret!\n\nI brag to friends and everyone at work that it's the best and if I run in to any East coasters that are homesick for pizza, I always send them here.  \n\nThe guys are great.  Take out or delivery...  They make custom orders to your liking and are honest friendly guys.  They suggested I buy my soda in the Rhino Mart becasue it was cheaper.  That earns my respect and loyalty!", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Pizza"]}
