We had a lovely lunch on a Saturday.  We were the only ones at the restaurant.  Excellent food, service and ambience.  They have two different plats at $20/person, pan-seared duck's breast or duck leg confit.  They start you with a soup or salad, than the main.  It's located just off of Old Montreal.  A good treat for duck lovers.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["French", "Restaurants"]}
