The kitchen is still working out timing and cooking issues. I ordered The Boss wings and the Coppers - one dry rub and one wet. The wet were under cooked with pink chicken and the dry rub came out black and over cooked on one side. Most of the runners and waitresses are high school seniors getting their first experience at service, or so we were told by our waitress. Our party of five food came out fast but the party of three table behind us waited almost an hour to get their food. With our fast food delivery quality was not great but the table that waited for a long time quality was on par for this chain restaurant. Again speaks to timing. We were charged extra for a cup of ranch for each of us that should have came with the wings. We asked to speak to the manager to correct our bill and show the quality of food but after a 15 min wait after the request we were told he was tied up in the kitchen. We had spent enough time in the establishment and just paid our bill this time. Unfortunately, we all boxed up most of our food not for fullness but quality. It will feed the pets instead of sending back as kitchen waist. I'm giving 3 stars because with all new openings kinks must be worked out. The selection of draft beers is great and not the usual five or six you regularly see. I've ate at Wild Wings before and it can become a favorite wing spot. The closest one I had before was in South Charlotte, an hour away. This one is at least only 30 min away from my current residence. Let's hope this one gets it together.", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "categories": ["Salad", "Restaurants", "Sandwiches", "Chicken Wings"]}
