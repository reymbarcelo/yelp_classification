We have used the drive thru on 6 separate occasions in a period of 4 months when we first moved to this neighborhood. EVERY time they forgot items for our order or gave us completely wrong food. Called a couple times to give 'em some feedback without being rude. It has been 2 years now since they screwed up our last order because we don't go there anymore. This Taco Bell/KFC is a mile from our house but we much rather drive 3 miles further and visit the other locations.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Fast Food", "Chicken Wings"]}
