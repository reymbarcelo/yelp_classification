I came in around 3:00 and there was one lady in front of me who left her wallet. While cashier went to retrieve the wallet, which took a couple of minutes (an eternity when you're waiting and there is someone else nearby to help), the other cashier didn't bother to step in and take my order. However, when cashier number 1 came back, someone was behind me and cashier number 2 asked if she could help the lady behind me. I was insulted.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the main issue. I ordered takeout and when I got back to the office to look at it, my soup wasn't full, nor was my hot chocolate. Additionally, my soup was watery. Not cool. Panera is slightly overpriced and I expect consistent servings of food. What I got was approximately 20% less than normal. Of course it's not worth it to go back and complain, but in the future I'll be sure to check before leaving the restaurant. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
