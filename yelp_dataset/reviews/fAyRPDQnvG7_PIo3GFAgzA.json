The brunches are ok after a late night... waffle machines, on-demand omelets, cereal, and donuts/sweets. Everything is very heavy and unhealthy, though. Be prepared to gain the freshman 15 very quickly if you eat here a lot. They try to rotate dinner foods, but everything starts to taste the same after a while. They clearly reuse foods from one day to the next which is pretty sketch. The servers tend to be pretty nice, though, which is surprising considering the messiness of the student patrons. I think I may've eaten dinner here once after no longer being on the mandatory meal plan, and that's totally ok with me.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Buffets"]}
