What kind of Italian place sells a cheeseburger?\n\nThe music is way too loud and very inappropriate for the type of restaurant, the service was horribly slow, it was a busy Sunday night and there was only one waiter serving everyone.\n\nThe food is okay, nothing great, and definitely not worth the price, for a better, slightly more casual experience head to the chain restaurant \"Famoso\" on Bloor, at least there you get better food for a lower price.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Italian", "Restaurants", "Mediterranean"]}
