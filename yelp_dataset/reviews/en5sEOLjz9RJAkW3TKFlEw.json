The name of the restaurant itself gives the menu away. They specialise in shellfish caught from creels. Due to the fact that the resultant is family owned and maintains a cosy family atmosphere it is no surprise that the food is bought fresh to the restaurant daily. I grew up on the north coast of Scotland and my dad loves this sort of food so we quite often popped in here for dinner when we go to Edinburgh. The restaurant is very successful and tends to gain a lot of tourists. Personally I don't think the food is that expensive when you consider all the local hard work and effort that goes into the food? I love sea food but am not over fussed on Shellfish but if you are then I seriously recommend you visit here if you are even in Edinburgh. The hospitability is very warming, you feel welcome and the staff are more than happy to chat to you and tell you how the food is caught. This is a quaint little place and I personally love what it stands for.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Seafood"]}
