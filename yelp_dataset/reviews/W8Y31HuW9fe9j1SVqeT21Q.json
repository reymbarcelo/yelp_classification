It's the Hard Rock Hotel and all of those kids working there have some kind of attitude (unless you're in the HRH tower, then you're golden)\n\nGo forth my dear reader, and enjoy some coffee made with a REAL espresso machine.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Cafes", "Food"]}
