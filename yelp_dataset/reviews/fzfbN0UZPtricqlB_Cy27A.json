We repeated our order about 4 times and they still got it wrong. They failed to mention they didn't have the toppings for the particular pizza we ordered and just brought something else which we didn't want. Then when we called them back after they just said we were wrong about it. \n\nTerrible service. No listening skills at all. The pizza was far from good to top it all off.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Food", "Restaurants", "Vegan", "Gluten-Free", "Pizza"]}
