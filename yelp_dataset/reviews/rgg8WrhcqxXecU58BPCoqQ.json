Prime location but everyone that works the drive thru either is having a bad day or hates there job.  This is the second time that they forgot something food wise that I paid for. Today was my Cesar salad and sauces and straws .  I was too busy to check the bag which I shouldn't have to anyways. The other time they forgot my large order of chicken nuggets. And when I do actually check they make me feel bad or stupid if I have to ask for straws or sauces that they forgot to put in the bag. This place should hire all new people or just close. It's just awful. Should be the best cause of all the traffic coming in and out.  Employees are so rude and mean.Go to culvers across the street.
