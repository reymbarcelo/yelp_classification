But after giving it three tries, I give up.\n\nIn every instance I ordered the Greek village salad with a chicken skewer.  And each time there was something off.  Either the chicken was half a portion or dry - or the salad was half rotten, or not even a village salad.\n\nDon't get me started on the rudeness of the young woman at the cash.\n\nFor $12, could you please, please get a basic salad and grilled chicken done right?  And for the love of Pete, nix that brown gloopy salad dressing!", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Greek", "Restaurants", "Food"]}
