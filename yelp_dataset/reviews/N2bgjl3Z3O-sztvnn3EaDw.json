Customer service is everything. As far as the food goes, I always get a pot pie with a side of the sweet potato souffl\u00e9. Another thing I like about this Boston Market is that it's adjacent to a side street that runs into a light, so you can get out on Independence. Traffic can be rough out that way.", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["American (Traditional)", "Caterers", "Restaurants", "Comfort Food", "Event Planning & Services", "Fast Food"]}
