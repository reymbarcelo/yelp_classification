Now I know basically what to expect from this chain but even this is absurd.  Won't answer the phone, deliveries are slow and staff has no idea what they are doing.  Our last order was made online and ended up being 2 hours late.  We ended up having to go over there only to find it was driving around town in a delivery car for a half hour.  No offer of anything to make good.  Staff was acting like little kids and it appeared there was no manager at the store.  Other families were having similar issues.  We eventually got the pizzas but they were over baked and dry.  Do yourself a favor and go to Mario's down the street. It's more expensive but you'll thank me!", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Sandwiches", "Restaurants", "Chicken Wings", "Pizza"]}
