I was impressed by how quickly the phone was answered, I wasn't placed on hold, and my order was communicated correctly the first time. When I arrived, my pizza was ready and correct. This location has been remodeled and it looks great. There was a neat digital board that showed where your pizza was in it's cooking process. All of the people working in somewhat of an assembly line reminded me of Snow White and the 7 Dwarves. Then there was the evolving door of delivery drivers. This is a very busy place on a Friday night. The final taste was my pizza. I had a thin crust with pepperoni and mushroom. It was \"okay\". Nothing to write home about, but standard for Pizza Hut. Could use more sauce. Good quick choice for a Friday night.", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "categories": ["Pizza", "Restaurants", "Chicken Wings", "Sandwiches"]}
