I almost always get the chicken fingers, which are a great price. It's something like $6 or $7 for them and they're a decent size and very filling. They make it for you right on the spot so it's always hot and fresh.\n\nI also need to point out that their fries are freakin' amazing. One time my friend ordered them and I couldn't stop having \"just one more.\" They really taste like In N Out fries, but a little better seasoned. \n\nAlso, the staff is incredibly nice. I was worried since I came in the morning-time to order a lunch food that they might get annoyed, but nobody even thought twice about it. It's my favorite part of Downtown Grand.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Arts & Entertainment", "Restaurants", "Delis", "Casinos"]}
