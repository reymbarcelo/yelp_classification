The employees are really bad. Alexander has no clue what good customer service is. Very rude tone. I preordered to pick up at 12, I come in at 11:52 and Alexander says \"you're 8 minutes early it's not ready.\" There was no one in the store, the employees were literally standing around until I walked in then they actually started cooking & doing their job, wow. So I come back at 12:10, they tell me it's still not ready. I work in the food industry as well, and this was definitely terrible.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Chicken Wings", "Restaurants"]}
