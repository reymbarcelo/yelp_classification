The food is very good here and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is pretty spacious too so you don't have to wait for a seat.  If you're looking for good traditional Japanese food come check this place out!", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "categories": ["Japanese", "Sushi Bars", "Restaurants"]}
