I had never even heard of this place until listed as one of the featured restaurants for black restaurant week. It was a bit of a trip getting there being that it's deep in huntersville but once there everything was amazing. It is def one of those mom and pops that i loveeee  I order the fish burger with fries which was extremely fresh. My friend had a 2 pc fish plate and another friend had a burger with fries and none of us had any issues with the food. In the midst of us being there a pastor was there who ordered way too much food and offered us an extra dish of crab legs shrimp corn and potatoes and I love a low country boil. It was amazing like the rest of the food. The ambiance here was cozy and welcoming! The staff was very polite and made me feel like I was home", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "categories": ["Chicken Shop", "Seafood", "Sandwiches", "Restaurants"]}
