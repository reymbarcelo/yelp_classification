The food is true soul food. It reminds me of everything delicious growing up in the south.  I go to the mall just to eat here. The employees are awesome. The sweet tea is amazing. You won't be let down. I recommend the chicken and greens. Of course the mac and cheese is delicious too. And the broccoli casserole, oh my goodness!!", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Southern", "American (Traditional)", "Restaurants", "Soul Food"]}
