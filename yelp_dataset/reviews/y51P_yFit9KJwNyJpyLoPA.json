I usually get there shortly after 8:00 when the gals are putting together the differs types of sandwiches for the day. I love their tuna fish!!!  Definitely some of the  best croissant and sandwiches downtown. Friendly and fast service in the morning.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "categories": ["Sandwiches", "Restaurants"]}
