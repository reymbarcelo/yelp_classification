I had a good experience upstairs so I thought the seafood would be good too. But I was wrong. We were seated at the far side of the restaurant and it was super hard to get a second round of anything. The fish was OK. In the end we just ordered the grilled pineapples and they were not as good as those we had upstairs. \n\nThe waitress explained that we had to ask for more food but that was not the experience I had upstairs in the steakhouse. I doubt it's true. They need a better strategy to serve food otherwise some customers are just not  going to get anything.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Brazilian", "Vegetarian", "Barbeque", "Seafood"]}
