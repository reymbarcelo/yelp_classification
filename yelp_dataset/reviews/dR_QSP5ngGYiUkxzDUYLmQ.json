The service was fine, but the quality of the food seemed to be cheap. I ordered the hamburger steak with mashed potatoes, and it seemed like it was a premade frozen hamburger. I was expecting a nice thick dark sauce, but that was not the case (see pic). The taste really wasn't that great. \nMe friend ordered the Thai salad but it was so spicy she couldn't even eat it. \n There were a couple other friends with me also and their food was also just okay. Nothing really stood out or made us want to go back.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Burgers", "Restaurants", "Pizza", "Delis", "Sandwiches"]}
