I tried Mai for the first time, getting takeout hibachi. Having reviewed the menu, I saw that mixed vegetables come with the meal. I asked if I could have the mixed vegetables without the onions. \"No, they are already mixed together.\" Ummmkay..... Then she tells me \"If you'd like to substitute it for broccoli or zucchini, we can do that.\" Seeing as how I like both of those, I ask to have broccoli and zucchini. Response \"No, you're not getting it. You can't have both. You have to choose one.\" -_- I felt her response was condescending. I'm not an idiot. I understood what she was saying, just didn't think it would be such a burden to put a 1/2 portion of broccoli and a 1/2 portion of zucchini. I finally gave up and chose broccoli. \n\nAfter all of that, I picked up my food. When I got home, I was disappointed that it simply wasn't very good. The shrimp had the tails. The rice had zero flavor. It was like egg flavored fried rice. No salts, spices, nothing. It just wasn't good. I wouldn't go back there or recommend it to anyone.", "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "categories": ["Asian Fusion", "Sushi Bars", "Japanese", "Restaurants"]}
