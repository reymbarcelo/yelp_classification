Better then most places so-called GF menus. \n\nJason and I both ordered gluten free breakfast sandwiches-his with sausage, mine with bacon (everything is better with bacon). \n\nThe service was good, quick and the food came out hot and fast. They use the burger bun for the breakfast sandwich bun-so it was a little too much bread but you can easily take off thebottom. Both sandwiches tasted exactly how they should for breakfast sandwiches. \nBoth meals came with american fries (I swear they used to have a different potatoe when I lived there) and a side of fruit. When I ordered I assumed it was either/or but ours came with both. \nThe potatoes were good and had flavor, althought I feel they could have given me a few more. The fruit-surprisingly was very fresh tasting and didnt taste like it was out a mass fruit bucket which most restaurants order. \n\nPrice was fair, gluten free buns cost .50 more, the sandwich meals were $7.00 and Jason ordered coffee so our bill was around $18.00 I think. \n\nPlace was clean and everyone was friendly.", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "categories": ["Diners", "Breakfast & Brunch", "American (Traditional)", "Restaurants"]}
