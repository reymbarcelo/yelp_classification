This restaurant prides itself on offering high quality food for anyone that crosses its path. I have only been here once and I must admit I was impressed with the food. From what I understand it is a long established restaurant in the area and it is very popular with the locals. The restaurant itself is not overly extravagant, it is fairly small but very authentic when you get inside, the music and the dim lighting give off a great atmosphere and you could almost feel like you are in India. I'm not a fan over hot curry so this place is good for me as they offer a wide variety of mild meals so there is something for everyone. It is not overly expensive for an Indian; I would go back again if I was in the area", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Pakistani", "Indian", "Restaurants"]}
