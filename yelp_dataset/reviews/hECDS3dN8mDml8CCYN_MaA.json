I actually hesitated to write a review because I don't want one of Vegas' best kept secrets to get out, but this place really does deserve 5 stars.  I was a bit worried when Fitzgerald's became The D, but Don B's has stayed the same and is just as good as ever.    The restaurant is conveniently located in the 2nd floor gaming area, but it's very quiet and comfortable inside.  You can't smell any smoke from the casino.\n\nLet me get to the best part - the food!  The filet mignon is hands-down the best steak I've ever had in Vegas.  The prime rib is also excellent.  One of these days I'm going to branch out and try a ribeye.  Each entree includes a generously sized potato (fried, baked, or garlic mashed) or rice, and a bread basket.  You can add a salad, side dish, or soup for only about $6.  In the last 5 years, the price of the entrees have only gone up a few dollars.  Service is always friendly, efficient, and best of all, not pretentious.  They won't rush you to finish your meal.  The tab won't break your bank (unless other Vegas steakhouses, where a steak alone sets you back $60).  Don B's is every bit as good as the Strip's many steakhouses, if not better.   I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Restaurants", "Steakhouses"]}
