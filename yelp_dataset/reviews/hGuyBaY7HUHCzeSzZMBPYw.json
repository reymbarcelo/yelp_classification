If you go at night when it's dark the drive-thru menu board is off so you can't see! And they close at 11pm I went there at 10:45 they did not want to answer the drive thru. The staff are horrible, they don't care about customer service. I would go to any other Wendy's but this one!!!", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "categories": ["Fast Food", "Burgers", "Restaurants"]}
