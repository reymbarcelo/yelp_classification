I was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl.  That was until I arrived and the menu was completely different than what I had remembered from the California Jack in the Boxes.  If the food was more consistent with the west coast this place would be a 4 star easily.  It is very clean, the staff was very friendly and the food although not being what I wanted or remembered was somewhat tasty.", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "categories": ["Fast Food", "Restaurants"]}
