# yelp_classification
SETUP:

`python multiclass_model.py`    

(just prints precision, recall, and accuracy)

`python multiclass_model.py v`  

(prints individual reviews as well)


TODOs:
- [ ] Add more feature extractors in **features.py**
- [ ] Try out different models in **models.py**
- [ ] Implement clustering, LDA (needs to be in a new file)
- [ ] Optimize model hyperparameters
- [ ] Decide on and implement different evaluation metrics (ie. precision, recall, F-score, ...) in **multiclass_model.py**
- [ ] Examine the way train/test datasets are generated and make sure they're roughly balanced.
- [ ] Append evaluation metrics to a specified file.
